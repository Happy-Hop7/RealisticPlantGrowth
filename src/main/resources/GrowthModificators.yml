#
# This configuration file adjusts the growth rate behavior of specified plants (Bukkit Materials)
# in relation to the vanilla game. A 'GrowthRate' of 100% mirrors vanilla behavior.
# Growth rates above 100% must be enabled in 'Config.yml' first. Higher rates introduce the
# possibility of plants skipping growth states or aging faster. Plants not specified in this
# file adhere to the vanilla GrowthRate.
#
# Example:
#
# WHEAT:                          <-- Bukkit Material name of the plant to be modified.
#   BiomeGroup:                       Settings related to BiomeGroups.
#     Groups:                     <-- List of BiomeGroups defined in 'BiomeGroups.yml'
#       - GreatGrowing                Example BiomeGroups with specific modifications for this plant.
#       - GoodGrowing                 Values must be defined below!  '[]' indicates no special modifications.
#     GreatGrowing:               <-- 1. BiomeGroup name (All listed BiomeGroups need to be specified!)
#       GrowthRate: 100           <-- 100% of Minecraft vanilla growth rate.
#       UVLightGrowthRate: 75     <-- 75% growth rate, if plant is in darkness and has only UV Light access.
#       NaturalDeathChance: 0     <-- 0% chance of plant randomly dies.
#       UVLightDeathChance: 5     <-- 5% change of plant randomly dies in darkness with only access to UV light.
#     GoodGrowing:                <-- 2. BiomeGroup name (All above listet BiomeGroups need to be specified!)
#       GrowthRate: 80
#       UVLightGrowthRate: 55
#       NaturalDeathChance: 5
#       UVLightDeathChance: 10
#   Default:                      <-- Default settings apply to all Biomes listed in 'Biome'
#     GrowthRate: 50                  (not overriding specified BiomeGroups)
#     UVLightGrowthRate: 25
#     NaturalDeathChance: 5
#     UVLightDeathChance: 25
#     Biome: []                   <-- Default settings apply to this list of biomes.
#                                     'ALL' means: apply to all vanilla biomes
#                                     '[]' means: NO GROWTH in every biome (except BiomeGroups listed above)
#
# Every biome not listed in the BiomeGroups or in the Biome list is considered a 'BAD' biome where
# the plant dies with a chance of 100%. Fertilizer in range can enable plant growth in 'BAD' biomes.
#
# Disclaimer:
# The GrowthModificators.yml settings provided here are EXAMPLES. Users are encouraged to customize and modify
# these settings based on their specific preferences and gameplay needs.
# Experiment with different growth rates in various biomes to create a unique and tailored
# experience in your Minecraft world.
#
# I would greatly appreciate sharing well-configured versions of this file with the community :)
