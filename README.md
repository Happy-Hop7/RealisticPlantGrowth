# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Realistic Plant Growth Plugin

Realistic Plant Growth is a powerful Spigot/Paper plugin that brings a new level of realism to
the Minecraft flora, allowing you to fine-tune growth parameters on a per-biome basis.

This Plugin is inspired by the plugin: [PwnPlantGrowth](https://github.com/Pwn9/PwnPlantGrowth) by [Pwn9](https://github.com/Pwn9).

In my version, I've updated the plugin to adhere to current Minecraft plugin standards, fixed various bugs, and restored features that were previously not working as intended.
