# üëã Welcome to the Realistic Plant Growth Plugin

Realistic Plant Growth is a powerful Spigot/Paper plugin that brings a new level of realism to
the Minecraft flora, allowing you to fine-tune growth parameters on a per-biome basis.

<br>

- Do you want to stop Nether Wart farming or make it only work in the Nether like it used to be?
- Do you think Melon farms are too powerful and want to balance them?
- Maybe you want cocoa to grow only in jungles or make plants grow slower in deserts?
- Or perhaps you want farms to be above ground and need natural light?

You can do all that with **Realistic Plant Growth**!


<br>

**Realistic Plant Growth** actively monitors grow events, allowing plants to progress through their growth stages based on a configured growth rate. <br>
What sets this plugin apart is its biome-dependent growth rate, providing an immersive experience tailored to the in-game environment.

<br>
