# RealisticPlantGrowth
A Spigot/Paper Plugin for Minecraft that makes plant growth more configurable, per biome.
This is a rewrite of the plugin: [PwnPlantGrowth](https://github.com/Pwn9/PwnPlantGrowth) by [Pwn9](https://github.com/Pwn9).

In my version, I've updated the plugin to adhere to current Minecraft plugin standards, fixed various bugs, and restored features that were previously not working as intended.
