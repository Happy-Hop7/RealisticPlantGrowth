# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Realistic Plant Growth Plugin

Realistic Plant Growth is a powerful Spigot/Paper plugin that brings a new level of realism to
the Minecraft flora, allowing you to fine-tune growth parameters on a per-biome basis.

This plugin draws inspiration from [PwnPlantGrowth](https://github.com/Pwn9/PwnPlantGrowth) by [Pwn9](https://github.com/Pwn9). <br>

Compared to the PwnPlantGrowth plugin, this iteration has been elevated to meet current Minecraft plugin standards, with various issues addressed and functionalities restored to their intended operation. <br>
Additionally, I've introduced more configurable plants, integrated plant death sounds and effects, implemented random replacement materials upon plant death, <br>
and improved the mechanics of UV-light and fertilizer for a more robust and immersive experience.

It's important to note that development is ongoing, and additional features are planned for the future.
